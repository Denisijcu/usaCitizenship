<p>The Louisiana Territory was a large area west of the Missippi River. It was 828, 000 square miles. In 1803, the United States bought the Louisiana Territory from France for $15 million. The Lousiana Purcharse Treaty was signed in Paris on April 30, 1803. It was the largest acquisition of land in American history. Farmers could now ship their farm products down the Missippi River without permission from other countries. This was important because the city of New Orleans was a major shipping port. The Louissiana Purchase doubled the size of the United States and expanded it westward. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark led an expedition to map the Loussiana Territory.</p>

<h1> <center> 74.- Name one problem that led to the Civil War</center></h1>
<lu>
<h3>  <center><li>Slavery </li> </center></h3>
<h3>  <center><li> Economic reasons</li> </center></h3>
<h3>  <center><li> States' rights</li> </center></h3>
</lu>
<br/>
<p>The Civil War began when 11 southern states voted to secede ( separate) from the United States to form their own country, the Confederate States of America. These southern states believed that the federal government of the United States threatened their right to make their own decisions. They wanted states' rights withe each state making their own decisions about their government. If the national government contradicted, they did not want to follow the national government. The North and South had very different economic systems.  The South's agriculture-based economy depended heavily on slave labor. The southern states feared  that the United States government would end slavery. The southern states believed that this would huert their economic and political independence. The economy of the northern  states was more industrial and did not depend on slavery. The northern states fought to keep all the United States together states fought to keep all the United States together in "the Union". They tried to stop the southern states from separating into a new Confederate nation. There were also many people in the North who wanted to end slavery. These differences led to the American Civil War, which lasted from 1816 until 1865. </p>

Abraham Lincoln was president of the United States from 1861 to 1865, and led the nation during the Civil War. Lincoln thought the separation of the southern (Confederate) states was unconstitutional, and he wanted to preserve the Union. In 1863, during the Civil War, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation. It declared that the slaves who lived in the rebelling Confederate states were forever free Lincoln is also famous for his "Gettysburg Address". He gave that speech at Gettysburg, Pennylvania, in November 1863. Earlier that year, at the Battle of Gettysburg, the northern (Union) army had won a major battle to stop the Confederate army form invading the North. To honor the many who died in this battle, the governor of Pennsylvania established the Soldiers' National Cementery at Gettysburg. Lincoln spoke at the dedication ceremony and praised those who fought and died in battle. He asked those still living to rededicate themselves to saving the Union so that "government of the people, buy the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth". On April 14, 1865, soon after taking office for his second term, Abraham Lincoln was killed  by a southern supporter, John Wilkes Booth, at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C.
