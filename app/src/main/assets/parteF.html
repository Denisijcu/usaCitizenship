<p>The modern civil rights movement in the United
States began in 1954 when the Supreme Court
ruled that racial segregation in public schools
was unconstitutional. The goal of the civil rights
movement was to end racial discrimination against African Americans and to gain full and equal rights
for Americans of all races. Using nonviolent strategies
such as bus boycotts, sit-ins, and marches, people
came together to demand social change. As a result,
Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The Civil Rights
Act made segregation in public facilities and racial
discrimination in employment and education illegal.
The law protects African Americans, women, and
others from discrimination. The Voting Rights Act
banned literacy tests and other special requirements
that had been used to stop African Americans from
registering to vote.</p>

<p>American Indians lived in North America for
thousands of years before the European settlers arrived.
Today there are more than 500 federally recognized
tribes in the United States. Each tribe has its own
social and political system. American Indian cultures
are different from one tribe to another, with different
languages, beliefs, stories, music, and foods. Earlier in
their history, some tribes settled in villages and farmed
the land for food. Other tribes moved frequently as
they hunted and gathered food and resources. The
federal government signed treaties with American
Indian tribes to move the tribes to reservations. These
reservations are recognized as domestic, dependent
nations.</p>
